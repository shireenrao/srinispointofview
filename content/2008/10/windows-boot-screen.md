So many times I have wanted to see why my windows is booting so slowly.
What drivers are causing problems... Well msconfig has a nice feature to
disable the eye candy bootup and just show what drivers are being
loaded!!  

On Windows XP open msconfig and go to the
BOOT.INI tab and check on the /SOS checkbox. The next time you bootup,
it will show what drivers are being loaded.

On Vista go to the Boot tab and check on the OS bootinformation check
box to do the same.
