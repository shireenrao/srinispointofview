Write your header message...

The rest of the content do as shown below - 

    ::::html
    <span class="fullpost"\>Keep other stuff within your span tags</span\>

I did this from
[here!](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=42215)

Only thing left to do is to enable or disable the "Read more!" which
shows up at the bottom of each post!
