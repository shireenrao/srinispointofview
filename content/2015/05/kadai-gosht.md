This dish is a very popular dish from North India. I have had this at restaurants and Dhaba's in and around New Delhi. So how is this different than all the different types of mutton I have made in the past. Well.. I did some research and found this recipe and tried it today. It came out really well!! I am really satisifed with the results and all I can say it's all in the execution. Here is the recipe -

Ingredients
----------- 

* Goat meat - 2 1/2 pounds in 1 to 2 inch chunks
* Onions - 2 big red onions sliced
* Tomatoes - 3 Vine tomotoes sliced
* Ginger and Garlic paste - 3 tbls
* Chili Powder - 1 tsp (2-3 if you want spicy)
* turmeric powder 1/2 tsp
* Cumin POwder - 2 tsp
* Coriander Powder - 3 tsp
* Salt - to taste
* Crushed Dried Fenugreek leaf - 1 tbls
* Green Chilies - 4-5 (may add 3-4 more if you want it spicy)
* Cilantro - 1/2 cup
* Yogurt - 1/2 cup
* Oil - 1 cup

Recipe
------

1. Heat oil in a dutch oven
2. Add the ginger garlic paste and cook for a minute
3. Add the goat meat and brown it for maybe 5 minutes.
4. Add the sliced onions and tomatoes
5. Add chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt and crushed fenugreek leave
6. Mix all the spices well into the meat, onions and tomatoes.
7. Now reduce heat to medium and put a lid on the dutch oven
8. You don't need to add any water. You will see a lot of liquid starts forming in the dish because of all the ingredients.
9. After 5 minutes add the yogurt and mix it into the dish. 
10. Keep mixing every 5-10 minutes and make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Cook for an hour or till the meat is tender.
9. Once you see the oil oozing at the top, add the green chilies and cilantro and mix it in the curry.
10. Now you can remove the lid and cook till the gravy reduces to required consistency. 
11. Serve with hot Naan or tandoori rotis
