I am super excited to finally get this end to end workflow to work. I am writing this post from Github, 
which in turn causes travis-ci to do a pelican build and finally push the build to shireenrao.github.io and also 
pushes the build to [my personal blog](http://www.nyayapati.com/srao). 

I will follow this up with a detailed how-to soon.
