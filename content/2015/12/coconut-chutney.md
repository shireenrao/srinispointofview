Coconut chutney goes great with Idli's, Dosa's and vadda's. One recent thread on my family's recipes group on facebook had a 
couple of variations on this traditional chutney. I will try to post all the different styles on making this dish.

M.S. Leela Method
-----------------
Ingredients - Take half a coconut
              two or three green chillies
              less than half teaspoonful of lal mirch powder,
              5-6 curry leaves
              A pinch of hing
              Tamarind or lime juice per taste
              
Method -      Add all above and make a smooth paste in a grinder/Mixie. Add salt to taste and finally 
              add a tadka of mustard seeds and curry leaves
              
Variation to above method from my aunt Suguna Rao - Add one table spoon of yogurt while making paste in the grinder.

Sita Rao Method
---------------
Take equal quantity of grated coconut and fried chutney dal. Add green chillies, salt and grind to smooth paste. 
Add a tempering of mustard seeds, jeera, udad dal and dried red chillies.

variation - add raw onion and ginger while grinding the smooth paste.
