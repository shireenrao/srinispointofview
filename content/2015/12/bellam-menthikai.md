This is my aunt Suguna Rao's recipe. This is a quick way of making this recipe. This does not involve drying the mango in the sun. 

Ingredients
-----------
1. One raw green mango (remove skin and cut into chips) - 2 cups
2. Gud - 1/2 cup
3. Salt - 2 tsp
4. Mirchi Powder - 1 tsp
5. Menthi podi - 2 pinch

Method 1
--------
1. Mix the cut mango with gud, salt and mirchi powder. Cover and keep aside
2. Next day add 2 pinches of menti podi and mix really well.

The above recipe does not last long and you need to finish it up quickly. If you want to make a bigger
batch and want it to last longer you need to put it out in the sun.

Method 2
--------
1. Mix the cut mango with gud and salt
2. keep it out in the sun everyday till you see it oozing a syrup
3. Add the mirchi powder and menti podi and mix well
