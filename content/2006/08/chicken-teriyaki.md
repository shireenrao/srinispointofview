This is one of Suren's favourite
dishes. It came out really well.. Next time I just have to make sure I
make the sauce less thick.

8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
(about 5 ounces each), trimmed, boned, and skin slashed  
Table salt and ground black pepper  
1/2 cup soy sauce  
1/2 cup sugar  
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger  
1 clove garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1
teaspoon)  
2 tablespoons mirin  
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

Position oven rack about 8 inches from heat source; heat broiler. Season
chicken thighs with salt and pepper; set thighs skin side up on broiler
pan (or foil-lined rimmed baking sheet fitted with flat wire rack),
tucking exposed meat under skin and lightly flattening thighs to be of
relatively even thickness (see illustration 6). Broil until skin is
crisp and golden brown and thickest parts of thighs register 175 degrees
on instant-read thermometer, 8 to 14 minutes, rotating pan halfway
through cooking time for even browning.

While chicken cooks, combine soy sauce, sugar, ginger, and garlic in
small saucepan; stir together mirin and cornstarch in small bowl until
no lumps remain, then stir mirin mixture into saucepan. Bring sauce to
boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally; reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced to
3/4 cup and forms syrupy glaze, about 4 minutes. Cover to keep warm.

Transfer chicken to cutting board; let rest 2 to 3 minutes. Cut meat
crosswise into 1/2-inch- wide strips. Transfer chicken to serving
platter; stir teriyaki sauce to recombine, then drizzle to taste over
chicken. Serve immediately, passing remaining sauce separately.
