In other words this is minced turkey
with green peas. Its a very easy dish to make and I would say it is
healthier than using minced lamb or beef. I first got the idea of using
turkey for this dish from my cousin, who like me is a foody. Some day we
might see a cookbook published by her ;)

Ingredients:

-   minced Turkey - 2 pounds
-   green Peas - 1/2 pound
-   ginger paste - 1 tsp
-   garlic paste - 1 tsp
-   cumin seeds - 1 tsp
-   onions - 2 medium sized
-   coriander powder - 1 and 1/2
    tsp
-   turmeric powder - 1/4 tsp
-   garam masala - 1 tsp
-   red pepper pwder - 3/4 tsp

Method:

Heat some oil in a wok. Add cumin seeds
and when it start sputtering add minced meat and start mixing into the
wok. Add the onions, the ginger and garlic paste and all the spices.
Keep mixing from time to time till you get a keema like look to it. The
onions will cook in the fat released by the minced meat. Add the green
peas and mix it into the keema. Now put the heat on medium and cover the
vessel. Once I was sure the meat was cooked and had the required taste,
I broke and layed out the eggs in the wok. Covered the wok and let the
eggs cook on low heat. I enjoy eating keema with rice. You can also have
it accompany it with some wet gravy based dish with rotis.
