This is one of my favourite dishes. I
love the flavour of onions with eggplant. The cilantro also enhances the
taste and smell of the dish. This is something one should have with rice
and goes well with [Sambar]({filename}/2006/06/sambar.md)

Ingredients:

-   3 tablespoons oil
-   1 Eggplant chopped into 1/2 inch pieces
-   2 onions, grated salt to taste
-   1 teaspoon red chilli powder
-   2 tablespoon chopped cilantro

Method:

Heat oil in a wok. Add the chopped eggplant. Saute on a open wok for 5
minutes.Add the salt and fry for another minute. Then cover your wok and
let the eggplant cookand become soft. Once you know that the eggplant is
soft, add the grated onions and fry the onions along with the eggplant.
Add the red chilli powder and mix it in the eggplant and onions. In the
end add the chopped cilantro and also mix it into the dish.
