Made my very first dosa, it came out well. The thing i was most excited
about was it did not break, it was crispy and tasty, how cool is that!

Ingredients (in hindi) were:

> 3 kadchi rice powder  
> 1 kadchi udad powder  
> Cumin seeds / jeera half  
> teaspoon  
> salt  
> dry Red chilie powder /lal mirchi powder  
> Asafoetida  
> powder 1 pinch / hing ek chutki bhari  
> Fresh green chillies / hari mirchi  
> Cilantro / Hara Dhania

kadchi = Ladle

Method:

Mix all the Ingredients in water till the batter is very thin. There is
no perfect measurement of water, only thing to keep in mind is that the
batter be thin with a little hint of viscosity.

Now take a flat iron wok(tava) place it on stove and heat it, then add
some oil and spread by brush. take 2 kadchi/ladle of liquid bater and
pour on the wok, don't flaten it with any other utensil, pour it in such
a way that it should cover all the wok and it should be flat.after that
add few drops of oil on the edges. then wait for a min or two until you
feel that its cooking well.

Loosen the edges of the dosa with a metal spatula. Use the spatula to
turn it then again after a min or two its ready to serve.

Just remember, the more falt you pour dosa it comes out more crispy,
ofcourse oil helps too :)
