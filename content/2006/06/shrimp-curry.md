Last Year in Summer I was in Orlando
with my family visiting Disney world. After an entire week of eating
out, we started craving for Indian food. I called up my friend who used
to work in Orlando and asked him for a Indian restaurant reference, He
suggested Dakshin(http://www.dakshin-orlando.com/). In my humble opinion,
it has been the best
restaurant I have been to in the USA. I dont know if it was because I
was very hungry or what... but me and my family had a great dinner. For
starters we ordered something called Kolambi Fry (Shrimps soaked in a
spicy marinade and shallow pan fried). I loved the dish so much that I
wanted to learn the dish. After I got back to boston, I searched the web
for the dish and came across a recipe. When I made it, I was very
satisfied with the outcome. The biggest mistake I did was I forgot to
write down the recipe. So today when I felt like making the dish again,
I couldnt find the recipe. Finally I came up with this recipe which was
not what I wanted but came out pretty good anyway...
