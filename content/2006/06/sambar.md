Sambar is part of any major meal at
home. We have it plain rice, dosa's, Idli's or wada's. I got this recipe
from my mom.

Ingredients:  

-   1 cup yellow split peas (tuvar dal)
-   2 cups water
-   2 onions, sliced in big pieces
-   1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
-   1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
-   3-4 dried red chilli
-   6-7 curry leaves
-   6-8 Fenugreek Seeds
-   2 tomatoes, sliced in big pieces
-   1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
-   2 green chilies, slit
-   1 carrot (optional, peeled and cubed)
-   2 drumsticks (optional)
-   5 okra, chopped (optional)
-   2 tablespoons oil
-   1 inch piece tamarind, soaked in a cup of hot water and extract juice
-   2 teaspoons sambhar powder (I use MTR sambar powder)
-   salt to taste
-   cilantro leaves (to garnish)

Method:

Boil the split peas in water till they
are soft. Churn the peas with a spoon,and it should turn into a soup
like consistancy (You can use a pressure cooker)

Heat the oil in a pot(I did it in a non stick pot). Once the oil is
hotadd the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, dry red chilli, fenugreek seeds
and curry leaves. After the mustard seeds start sputtering(make sure the
cuminseeds dont burn) add the sliced onions and any optional vegetables
you like. I like the okra, carrots and drumsticks in my sambar. Just
saute for 2-3 minutes.

Now add 4-5 cups of water to the pot. Add the extracted tamarind juice,
turmeric powder, salt, green chilies and tomatoes and bring it to a
boil.

Once the pot comes to a boil add the boiled split peas. Keep on
boilingfor 5 more minutes and then add the sambar powder.

After the sambar powder has been added boil for another 5 minutes add
choppedcilantro leaves. Then boil for another 5 minutes or till the time
the sambar comes to a nice soupy consistancy.
