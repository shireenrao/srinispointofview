This dish is a little modified than
what you normally get in the restaurants. Ihave the added twist of also
having mushrooms in it. One reason I tried out this dish was to impress
my would be wife as it is one of here favourite dishes! It came out
really well! I suggest you eat this with warm chapatis.
