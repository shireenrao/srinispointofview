This one is the original method of cooking moong dal. In cooker, cook

In a wok (kadai) add Ghee give tadka of jeera, hing powder, add lal
mirch powder ( be carefull, as soon as you add the mirchi powder add
water or else it will get burnt) Then Add the dal. In the end add
chopped dhaniya

Style 2(Pyaaz and tomato chounk)
