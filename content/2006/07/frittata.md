Ingrediants:

- 12 large eggs  
- 3 tablespoons half-and-half Table salt and ground black pepper  
- 2 teaspoons olive oil  
- 1/2 pound asparagus , trimmed of tough ends, spears cut on the bias into 1/4-inch pieces  
- 1 medium shallot , minced (about 3 tablespoons)  
- 4 ounces deli-style baked ham , 1/4-inch-thick, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 3/4 cup)  
- 3 ounces Gruyère cheese , cut into 1/4-inch cubes (about 3/4 cup)

Method:

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, about 5 inches from heating
element; heat broiler. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and
1/4 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl until well combined, about 30
seconds. Set eggs aside.

Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick ovensafe skillet over medium heat until
shimmering; add asparagus and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly
browned and almost tender, about 3 minutes. Add shallot and ham and cook
until shallot softens slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir Gruyère into eggs;
add egg mixture to skillet and cook, using spatula to stir and scrape
bottom of skillet, until large curds form and spatula begins to leave
wake but eggs are still very wet, about 2 minutes. Shake skillet to
distribute eggs evenly; cook without stirring for 30 seconds to let
bottom set.

Slide skillet under broiler and broil
until frittata has risen and surface is puffed and spotty brown, 3 to 4
minutes; when cut into with paring knife, eggs should be slightly wet
and runny. Remove skillet from oven and let stand 5 minutes to finish
cooking; using spatula, loosen frittata from skillet and slide onto
platter or cutting board. Cut into wedges and serve.
