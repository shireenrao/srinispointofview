Its been ages since I have written anything at all. It doesnt meen I
havnt been cooking.. It just means, i havnt made anything interesting
recently. Actually thats not true!

My Wife loves cheesy pasta.. She is a big fan of white sauce! When we go
out to a Itallian dinner, thats what she looks for.. So I thought I
would try to cook her something which would be cheesy and also different
than what she is used to.

I turned to chow.com and posted a request for suggestions and a lot of
people gave me good ideas. Finally here is what I made

sauted garlic and shallots in olive oil.  
added chopped baby bellas.  
Once the mushroom softened up a bit, added some flour and mixed it up in
the mushroom and shallots and garlic.  
Then added some white wine and cooked the entire thing till I reduced
the wine.  
Then added vegetable broth and cream and let it reduce for a few
minutes.  
I then added half a can of diced tomatoes and some itallian seasoning
and salt to taste.  
Once the entire sauce looked to come together, I added crumbled
gorgonzolla cheese,  
some grated smoked gouda cheese and grated parmessan cheese.

I finally mixed this into farfalle I had cooked earlier before starting
the sauce.

The dish looked heavenly and the combination of the three cheeses was
just so tasty!!

I will post a picture soon!
