I finally found my kolumbi fry recipe. If anybody has been following my
blog, I had earlier written about my quest for this recipe I had tried.
Read [here]({filename}/2006/06/shrimp-curry.md) for details if you havn't read it
before. Yesterday I got a great deal for shrimp at my local grocery
store and my craving for that recipe came back. So I googled and googled
and googled some more.. Tried all sorts of search string.. kolambi fry,
shrimp masala, manglorean shrimp fry, shrimp fry, shrimp snack, marvan
shrimp fry, marvan shrimp curry, dry shrimp masala.. no success! Then I
thought I should include some of the ingredients in my search and sure
indeed I hit jackpot!! I remembered that my recipe used only dry spices
and one of the spices was Asafoetida. Searching "shrimp kolambi
asafoetida" got me my page!! Here is the
