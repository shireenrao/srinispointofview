I saw this recipe in a book and found the recipe to be interesting...
We decided to try it out for a pot luck get together and every one loved
it.. Its a very easy recipe and just took few moments for us to cook
this wonderful appetizer.

Ingredients:

> Cooked and peeled shrimp - 1 pound  
>  Ginger-garlic paste - 1 tsp  
>  Chilli powder - 1 tsp  
>  Turmeric pwd - 1 tsp  
>  Black mustard seeds - 2 tsp  
>  Ghee or butter - 4 tbsp  
>  Coconut milk - 1/2 cup  
>  Salt and pepper - as per taste  
>  Chopped fresh coriander

Method:

Even though the shrimp were de-veined, I prefer to clean the shrimp and
also look through it to see if any shrimp has any vein in it.  
Pat dry the shrimp  
Put ginger garlic paste, chilli pwd, turmeric pwd, mustard seeds in a
bowl.  
Heat wok until hot and add ghee or butter and swirl it around until
foaming.  
Add the marinated shrimp and stir fry till the water released
evaporates. Over cooked shrimp taste rubbery, so make sure u don't over
cook it. If little bit water is left, let it be.  
Add coconut milk and let it simmer for some more time.  
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle coriander.  
And you have just finished making a fabulous finger food :)
