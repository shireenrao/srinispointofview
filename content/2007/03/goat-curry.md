I think this has been my best attempt
at making goat curry. I have made goat curry both in south indian style
and north indian style. the major difference between the two style is
that in South indian Style I add coconut milk and curry leaves. The
other big thing I have started to do is I pressure cook the meat to make
it soft and tender.. I love it when the meat is falling off the bone.
Getting goat meat has also become a little easier around the boston
region. I used to buy it in Quincy from this middle eastern halal
store.. but the meat was not that good... Somebody at work suggested I
go to
[Cheema's](http://www.wcities.com/en/record/240,67569/34/record.html) on
Cambridge Street in Allston, and I think they have their permanent
customer in me...

Ingredients:

>  Goat Meat cut in small one inch chunks - 3 Pounds  
>  Ghee (Clarified Butter) - 4 table spoons  
>  Cinamon Stick - 2 inches  
>  Cardamom - 5-6 pieces  
>  Cloves - 5-6 pieces  
>  Onions - 2 large chopped  
>  Ginger Garlic paste - 2 tsp  
>  Tomatoes - 2 chopped  
>  Potatoes - 2 cut in big pieces  
>  Salt to taste  
>  Red Pepper Powder - 1 tsp  
>  Turmeric Powder - 1/4 tsp  
>  Garam Masala - 1 1/2 tsp  
>  Coriander (Dhaniya) Powder - 2 tsp  
>  MDF Meat Masala - 2-3 tsp

Method:

Heat the Ghee in Stainless steel wok  
Add the cinamom stick, cardamoms and cloves.  
Saute till they start to crackle.  
Add the onions and saute them till they are a nice golden colour.  
Add all the powder spices except the meat masala and mix it into the
onions  
Now add the meat sear it so it gets cooked on all sides.  
Once the meat is browned on all sides add the tomatoes and mix it into
the meat.  
Transfer all of this into the pressure cooker and add enough water to
immerse the meat.  
Add 2-3 teaspoons of MDF Meat Masala and the potatoes and close the
cooker.  
Cook for 20 miuntes.  
Put the cooker under cold water if you want to check if the meat became
tender.  
Pressure cook again if it has not become tender.  
Make sure you have enough water or else you might burn your gravy!  
If the gravy is too watery just let it cook on medium heat.  
Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice.
