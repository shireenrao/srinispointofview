This came out fabulously.. I looked up quite a few recipes and different
styles of making biryani.
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani) gives a nice
explaination in the different styles of biryani making. Finally I
thought that for a first time biryani maker, I should try out Sanjeev
Kapoor's recipe. Check out his video demo

[here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3920560552662260416).  

Here is what it looks like right before I put it to dum.

And here I tried my hand at plating the biryani.. I know I need to work
on making a better presentation :)
