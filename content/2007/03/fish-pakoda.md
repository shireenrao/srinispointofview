My Friend Tina always complained that we did not visit her often, so she
came up with a plan. She would call us and tell us that her mom prepared
"fish". Me and Poorni would be there in a jiffy. Personally I dont like
fish too much because of the fishy taste but aunty prepares it in such a
way that it just tastes awesome!!

I decided to make this recipe for a get together and called up my
friend for the recipe. It still did not come out as aunty's,
nevertheless it tasted good. Here is the recipe -

Ingredients:

> Pompfret Fish - 2 pounds (I used Tilapia)  
>  lemon juice - 1 tsp  
>  red chillie powder - 1 and 1/2 tsp  
>  turmeric pwder - 1/4 tsp  
>  black pepper powder - 1 tsp  
>  ginger garlic paste - 1 tsp  
>  curry leaves - 6 - 8 leaves  
>  salt

Method:

Fish should be cleaned up and scaled. Rub salt all over the fish and
wash it. Do this 2-3 times. I was told this helps in removing some of
the fishy smell. Pat dry the fish abd cut into bite size pieces. Now mix
all the ingredients and around half of the curry leaves in a bowl and
marinate over night. When you are ready to make this, heat oil in a
vessel and when the oil is hot add some curry leaves and deep fry the
fish. Serve it with coriander chutney.
