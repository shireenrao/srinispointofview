I love to cook itallian food for my
wife. Itallian cooking to me is very calming and very romantic and it
always puts me in a great mood. I put on some nice music and open a
bottle of wine and then start cooking... I think this is my first
Ittalian recipe for my blog.. hope you try it out and like it!


Ingredients:


>  4 tablespoons olive oil  
>  1 large shallot, minced (about 1/4  cup), plus 1 shallot, sliced  
>  3 garlic cloves, minced  
>  10 ounces baby portobello mushrooms, chopped into 4 parts each  
>  3/4 cup chopped onion  
>  1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes in juice  
>  1/2 cup dry white wine  
>  1/2 cup chopped fresh basil  
>  1 pack of Spaghetti  
>  3/4 cup vegetable stock or canned vegetable broth  
>  1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese  
>  1/4 cup drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced  
>  Additional grated Parmesan cheese

  
Method:


Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.
Add minced shallot and 1 minced garlic clove and sauté until tender,
about 5 minutes. Increase heat to high, add all mushrooms, and sauté
until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer mushroom mixture to bowl.


Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in same skillet over medium heat.
Add onion, sliced shallot, and remaining 2 garlic cloves; sauté until
tender, about 5 minutes. Add diced tomatoes with juices and white wine
and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in mushroom mixture and 1/4 cup fresh basil.
Remove from heat. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper; cover to
keep warm. (Mushroom sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and
refrigerate. Rewarm mushroom sauce before continuing.)


Cook pasta in heavy large pot of boiling salted water until tender but
still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Return pasta to
pot. Add mushroom sauce to pasta and toss to coat. Add vegetable stock
and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, tossing to coat. Transfer to bowl; sprinkle
sun-dried tomatoes and remaining 1/4 cup basil over. Serve, passing
additional Parmesan cheese separately.
