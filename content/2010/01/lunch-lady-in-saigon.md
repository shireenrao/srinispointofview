I was watching Anthony Bourdain in Vietnam where he was talking about
the lunch lady in Saigon. My mouth was watering so much, watching her
make her soup! Apparantly she makes a different soup everyday.. Here is
a blogpost I found with more details.. If I ever get to go to Vietnam..
It's top of my list to try out!!
