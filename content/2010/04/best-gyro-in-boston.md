My quest for the best gyro sandwich is over!! Mick from
timony.com/mickzblog pointed me to Zo Boston after seeing my yelp
postings on other gyro places I had been to.  
I fell in love with the first bite. The sandwich is soo tasty!! Don't
know if it is the tzatiki sauce or the fresh warm pita bread or the
tasty pork meat.. Maybe it's the combination of all the ingredients...
It doesn't matter.. What matters is how tasty this sandwich is!!

Zo Boston is different from other gyro places.. The way they are
different is because of how they cook and add the meat to the sandwich.
Other places have strips of meat in their sandwich whereas Zo shreds
it's pork meat!!

The last time I was there, I found out that they also serve a chicken
and pork combination Gyro sandwich... Man!! I love it when places have
secret menu items.. It makes the experiance even more fun!! I can't wait
to go back and try the chicken and pork combination Gyro!!
