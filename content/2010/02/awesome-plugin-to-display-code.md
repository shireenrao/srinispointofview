I was writing a blog post on a myeclipse bug (is this really a bug?) and
saw that the code I was trying to display on my blog was not rendering
correctly. Part of the code got hidden and the formatting of the entire
page looked really bad. I have seen websites which show code boxes which
show code in their blogs.. so started my search for a good plugin. I
found WP-CodeBox and have loved it so far. Go to the
[WP-CodeBox](http://www.ericbess.com/ericblog/2008/03/03/wp-codebox/)
home page for details. You can see it in action
