I have been thinking about cooking chicken a little differently than
what I have normally been making lately. Lately I cook it with a south
Indian flare as that is how my wife, me and my brother like it. You can
find the recipe for the south indian spicy chicken curry here. The end
result looks a little like my other curry but the taste is very
different.

My memories of adraki chicken are from Nagpur. We used to go to this
restaurant called Sanjha Chulha in Sadar. They called it ginger chicken
and it was so so good. One would think seeing the name that it is a
Indo-chinese dish... but it was a very tasty north Indian dish. Me and
my friend would get a dish each and finish it all :)

Here is my attempt -

Ingredients:

>  chicken thighs- 1.5 pounds  
>  onions 3 small chopped  
>  1 larger tomato - chopped  
>  fresh ginger/garlic paste 6 tsp  
>  2 tsp grated ginger  
>  1 tsp jeera  
>  3 green chillies sliced  
>  3 tbl spoonÂ  ghee

Marinate for an hour:

>  fresh grated pepper  
>  deghi mirch  
>  salt  
>  lime juice  
>  garam masalla  
>  3 tsp ginger garlic paste

Method:

1\. heat ghee in a kadai  
2. add green chillies. take it out once slightly cooked  
3. Add a tsp of jeera  
3. Saute onions in the ghee. Add half a tsp of salt to speed up browning of the onions  
4. After carmalising, add 3 tsp of ginger garlic paste and the green chillies.  
5. add all the masalas  
6. Add tomatoes.  
7. Cook to make a nice consitency  
8. Add the marinated chicken. turn the chicken around in the masala and partially cook to get some white in the chicken.  
9. Add a glass of water  
10. Add 2 tsp of kasoori methi  
11. Add 2 tsp of grated ginger  
12. Reduce flame and cook covered for 5 minutes. Mix the gravy and chicken a couple of time and make sure the masala does not stick.  
13. Taste to make sure salt is right.

Hope you enjoy it as much as we did
