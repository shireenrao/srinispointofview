Chicken 65 - Any Hyderabadi's favorite dish! Well, I guess maybe after
the hyderabadi Biryani :)  I dont want to start any holy wars here but
today my post is about Chicken 65. A lot has been talked about this
dish's origin which can read on
[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_65). I believe Sanjay
Thumma from [vahrehvah.com](http://www.vahrehvah.com) got it right by
saying this chicken dish was the 65th item on a menu. As popularity rose
in the restaurant, it started being called Chicken 65.

I was browsing the internet the other day and came across a friends
photo blog of his recent visit to India on facebook. Being a self
proclaimed foodie, watching the slideshow was very torturous, but it got
some really good memories of places to eat in New Delhi and Hyderabad. I
thought the best way to deal with this would be to cook this dish. I
called my cousins and we decided to meet up that day. I offered to make
chicken 65 as an appetizer and my cousin offered to make spaghetti in a
turkey meat sauce(yum) for dinner.  Ultimately I was very glad with the
results of my dish. I think this has been my best attempt so far in
making this dish. Here is the recipe -

Ingredients

Marinate chicken for an hour in salt, pepper, deghi mirch 1.5 tsp, lal mirch 1.5 tsp,.5 tsp of MSG  
Mix the chicken in the marinate and while mixing add an egg to the chicken and then mix in corn starch  
Whisk  the rest of the spices in yogurt and keep aside  
Fry the chicken and make pakodas and keep aside

The reason this does not look red in color was because I did not use any
food coloring.
