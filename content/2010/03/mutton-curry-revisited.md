I got about 5 pounds of goat leg from [Waltham India
Grocer](http://www.yelp.com/biz/waltham-india-grocery-waltham-2). It is
an Indian grocery store which also sells Halal meat. I normally get my
meat from [Cheema
Supermarket](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cheema-supermarket-allston) but as
I was in the neighborhood, I just picked it up from Waltham.

I was making my usual Mutton Curry and half way through making this dish
I realized I did not have any crushed tomatoes.. so I had to improvise.
According to some purists Goat curry should not have any tomatoes. I
have always used tomatoes.. so this was a chance to try make this dish
without tomatoes... Unfortunately I don't have a picture to show on how
this looks.Â  It was a big hit at the party and that's what counts :)

Here is how I did it...

Ingredients

1.  Goat leg - cut into small pieces (1 inch)
2.  Onions chopped - 4 large onions chopped
3.  cinnamon - one 2 inches stick
4.  cardamom - 5-10
5.  cloves - 10-15
6.  curry leaves - 10-12 leaves
7.  green chillies - 4-5 cut into big pieces
8.  garlic - 5-6 pods finely diced
9.  ginger - finely diced - 2 inches
10. turmeric - 1-2 tsp
11. garam masala - 3 tsp
12. dhaniya powder - 4 tsp
13. lal mirch - 2 tsp
14. degi mirch - 2 tsp
15. jeera powder - 2 tsp
16. MDF Meat masala - 1 tsp
17. Coconut milk - 1 can

Method

1.  Heat oil and some ghee in a big flat bottom vessel.
2.  Add Cinnamon, cardamom and cloves
3.  Once it sputters, add onions and start frying it. Add the salt to
    taste and turmeric immediately.
4.  Once it is slightly brown, add the chopped ginger and garlic.
5.  Continue sauteing and add the chopped green chillies and curry
    leaves.
6.  Add the mixed powdered spices
7.  Make sure you don't burn the spices. Add a little ghee like maybe
    half a teaspoon.
8.  Add the mutton and coat the onions and spices to all the meat.
9.  Sear the meat so it cooks and changes color on all sides.
10. Add a can of coconut milk and mix everything together. After 5
    minutes transfer all to a pressure cooker.
11. Wash the vessel you used and use the water for the pressure cooker.
    Put enough to cover the meat.
12. Add a cut potato in the cooker. This helps bring some texture to the
    gravy.
13. Add 2 tsp of MDF Meat masala.
14. Add chopped cilantro and then pressure cook for 30-40 minutes.
15. Once the pressure comes down, open and check if the meat is tender.
    If not tender, pressure cook for 10-15 more minutes.
16. Taste and adjust salt
17. Serve with Rice
