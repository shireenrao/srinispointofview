Pasta is comfort food for me, specially white sauce pasta. I try to make
the cooking exciting by changing the recipe at times. Some times I add
tomato sauce to it or there are time when I have even tried to use
cooking wine to my white sauce. I came across this recipe in one of the
abundant cook books we have at home. I changed a few things on it and
added few ingredients like garlic, chilly flakes etc to make it more
flavorful.

The recipe goes like this -

Ingredients

-  Rotini                                             1 pound  
-  Egg yolks                                          3  
-  Freshly grated Parmesan cheese                     7 tablespoon  
-  Ricotta Cheese                                     1 cup  
-  Light Cream                                        4 tablespoon  
-  Butter                                             3 tablespoon  
-  Onion (sliced)                                     1  
-  Green peppers                                      1  
-  Salt, red chilly flakes and pepper per your taste

Method

-   Cook pasta as per instruction
-   Meanwhile mix the egg york, grated Parmesan and ricotta cheese in a
    bowl. Add the cream and mix it with a fork.
-   Melt butter in a pan. Saute garlic. Add onions and fry till golden
    brown
-   Add green pepper and salt. Cover and cook till the green peppers are
    tender.
-   Add the cream sauce and then add pasta.
-   You can add black pepper and red chilly flakes according to your
    taste.

This pasta has to be eaten hot as soon as it is cooked. The sauce tend
to thicken if you wait.
