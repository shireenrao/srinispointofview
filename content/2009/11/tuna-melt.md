My Brother-in-law Sumeet Diddee, made this fabulous tuna-melt which was
so so good.. I always wanted to try out his recipe and finally got
chance to do it the other day. I had to ask him for the recipe again and
here it is. very quick and easy to make.

Ingredients:  
1 can bumble bee tuna in oil  
5-6 sliced mushrooms  
1 green pepper chopped  
1/2 chopped onion  
1 small tomato chopped

Recipe:

Saute Onions, green peppers, tomatoes, mushroom for two minutes  
Add the tuna. Add salt and pepper and saute for another minute  
Add this to sandwhich bread and and add two slices of your favourite
cheese.  
I use american white cheese.  
Now Grill it on a griddle...
