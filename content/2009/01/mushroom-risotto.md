Priya loves risotto! She loved it the first time we had it together
while we were in Vieques.. I know she will order it at a restaurant if
its on the menu. It got me thinking about how difficult would it be to
make... Looking at recipes I found out that the rice used to make
risotto is kinda special. It's called Arborio rice. It is a medium grain
rice and it is firm and creamy due to the high starch content. It was
definitely not easy to make because you have to keep mixing the rice and
adding the broth little by little, till it is cooked. It took me around
30 minutes.. Here is the recipe from my itallian cookbook

Ingredients

-   2 cups mushroom (we used a mix of portabella and crimini)
-   juice of lemon (1/2 lemon)
-   butter 6 tbsp
-   2 tbsp chopped parsley
-   4 cups vegetable stock
-   2 tbsp olive oil
-   1 shallot chopped
-   1 1/2 cup risotto rice (arborio)
-   salt and fresh ground pepper
-   3 tbsp fresh grated Parmesan

Method

-   Chop the mushroom really small and then toss it with the lemon juice
-   Melt 2tbsp butter and stir in the mushroom. Cook over moderate heat
    till they give up their juices, and begin to brown. Stir in the
    parsley. Cook for 30 seconds and then remove to a side dish.
-   Place the stock in a saucepan and simmer till needed.
-   Heat 2 tbs butter with Olive oil in the same pan the mushroom were
    cooked in. Stir in the chopped shallots and cook until it is soft
    and golden. Add the rice, stirring for 1-2 minutes to coat it with
    oils. Add the mushrooms and mix well.
-   Now on moderate heat add one small ladle full of the hot stock and
    cook until the stock is absorbed or evaporates, stirring the rice
    with a wooden spoon to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Add a
    little more stock, and stir until rice dries again. Continue
    stirring and adding the liquid a little at a time. After about 20
    minutes of cooking time, taste the rice . Add salt and pepper.
-   Continue cooking, stirring and adding the liquid until the rice is
    al dente, or tender but firm to the bite. The total cooking time of
    the risotto may be from 20-35 minutes.
-   Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the remaining butter and
    cheese. Allow the risotto to rest for 3-4 minutes before serving.
