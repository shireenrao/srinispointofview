It has been ages since I have posted any recipes and I had to post this
dish as it is something special. It's not very complicated and is very
tasty. This is a North Indian Chicken curry. It is better to cook this
with chicken on the bone. I do it with chicken drum sticks and wings.
Turns out fabulous!!

Here are the ingredients -

Large onions, sliced - 2  
Ginger and Garlic paste - 2 Table Spoons  
Tomatoes, peeled and chopped  
Red chilli powder 1 tsp  
Turmeric - 1/2 tsp  
Cumin Seeds - 1 tsp  
Coriander Powder - 3 tsp  
Black Cardamoms - 3  
Cloves - 5-6  
Bay leaf - 1  
Salt to taste  
Yogurt - 1/2 cup  
Chopped cilantro

Method -

1\. Heat 1/4 cup of cooking oil in a thick bottom vessel. Add the sliced
onions and cook till brown. Remove the onions and make a fine paste of
the fried onions.  
2. Add a little more oil to the vessel and heat. Add ginger garlic
paste and stir for a minute or so.  
3. Add the chopped tomatoes and stir it well. a couple of minutes
later, add the yogurt and cook for 4-5 minutes and keep mixing.  
4. Add the browned onions paste and mix it well into the vessel.  
5. Add all the spices along with salt. Cook and stir the dish until oil
separates out.  
6. Add the chicken pieces and mix the masala into the chicken.  
7. Add 2-3 cups of water and cover up the vessel and reduce the heat to
low heat.  
8. Stir occasionaly and cook for 45-50 minutes till chicken is cooked
completely and tender.  
9. Remove the lid and cook for another 10 minutes.. you should see the
oil in the sauce separate out. Add the chopped cilantro and mix that
into the curry  
10. Serve with hot naan or rice!!
