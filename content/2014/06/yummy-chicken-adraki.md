This dish came out really good!! Very tasty if I can say so myself. It
is not very different from my previous effort which you can read
[here]({filename}/2010/02/adraki-chicken.md). There were slight changes, so I am
writing it down so I remember what I did and of course to share it with
everybody.

Ingredients -

-   Ghee - 2 tbsp
-   Green Chillies - 3-5 depending on how spicy you want
-   cumin - 1 tsp
-   Chopped Onions - 2
-   Ginger Garlic Paste - 3 tsp
-   Dhaniya powder - 2 tsp
-   Garam Masala - 1 tsp
-   Turmeric Powder - 1/2 tsp
-   Kashmiri Mirch - 1/4 to 1/2 tsp depending on how spicy you want
-   Julienned Ginger - from a 1 and half inch of ginger
-   Cilantro - 1/2 cup chopped
-   Tomatoes - 2 chopped
-   Kasoori Methi - 2 tsp crushed
-   Salt - to taste

Marinate 2 pounds of Chicken thighs(cut bite sized) for at least 30
minutes -

-   2 tbl spoons ginger paste
-   2 tsp Black pepper powder
-   1/2 tsp Turmeric
-   1 tsp Salt
-   Juice from 1 lemon

Method -

-   heat two table spoons of ghee in a thick bottomed pan. Once the ghee
    is hot, add 3-4 slit green chillies. Once it is slightly cooked,
    take them out with a slotted spoon and save for later.
-   Add 1 tsp cumin seeds to the hot ghee.
-   Once cumin starts sputtering, add the chopped onions and sauté. Add
    a tsp of salt to help with the caramelizing.
-   Once the onions are slightly browned, add the 2 tsp of fresh ginger
    garlic paste and mix it well into the onions and sauté for another 2
    minutes
-   Now add all the powdered spices.. 2 tsp of Dhania powder, 1 tsp of
    garam masala, 1/2 tsp Kashmiri mirch and 1/2 tsp turmeric powder.
    Mix all the spices into the onions.
-   Add the sautéed green chillies and chopped Chicken and mix it well
    into the onions. Saute the chicken so all the pink goes away. It may
    take 3-5 minutes.
-   Add the julienned ginger and chopped cilantro and mix it well into
    the onions and chicken and sauté some more till you see some oil
    releasing around the edge of the vessel
-   Add the 2 chopped tomatoes into the vessel and mix it well into the
    chicken, scraping the bottom making sure nothing is getting stuck.
-   Lower the heat and cover the vessel. Check every two minutes and mix
    the chicken and make sure nothing is sticking at the bottom.
-   Once tomatoes loose their structure and you see a nice consistent
    gravy, crush 2 tsp of Kasoori Methi between your palms and add to
    the dish. Mix it well
-   Taste to make sure salt is right
-   Check to see if chicken is cooked
-   Serve with hot chapati's or lachedar parathas
