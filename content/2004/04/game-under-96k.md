Its hard to believe this, but its true!! The guys at [the
produkkt](http://theprodukkt.com/) have released a game which is under
96K. I tried playing it and surprisingly it has really nice game play.
It was a little slow..(maybe because of my new 3 GHz P4 computer) but
the game has really nice graphics. This was posted in
