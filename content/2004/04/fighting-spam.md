I hate spam. I hate it when I see emails from people trying to sell
drugs or are trying to make ur body parts grow to abnormal sizes!! I
have put in a mail filter which deletes any email depending upon some
rules, like from people trying to sell drugs like vicodin, xanax and
cialis. But the spammers are getting smart. They are now sending emails
with cryptic subjects which is difficult to be caught by my filters.
Some of these emails baffle me. What is the use of sending an email
without any meaning or without trying to sell me something. There are so
many places you can get help to get rid of spam. Some links given here
are for [procmail](http://www.procmail.org/). Procmail is a mail filter
program which has many uses. You can use it to delete unwanted email or
sort incoming mail to your desired folders depending on the sender.
