Every year in the summer, on the 3rd sunday of every month,
between april and October, MIT has a
[swapfest](http://web.mit.edu/w1mx/www/swapfest.html). I have been
attending this swapfest for the last couple of years and you never know
what you can find. This is a place to buy, sell, and swap amateur radio,
electronic, and computer equipment. Many times I have found good deals
on old games and books. Be sure to take a copy of the flyer to get a
discount on your entrance fee.
