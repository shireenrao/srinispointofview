This is how I remember eating Bread Pakora's in Amar Colony, New Delhi.
So the other day when I suggested to Priya that we should try making
Bread Pakoras with Paneer, Priya was inspired!

This is Priya's recipe -

**Ingredients**  
Paneer  
Dhaniya chutney  
Chat masala  
White Bread  
Besan (Chick Pea Flour) - 1 Cup  
Red Chili powder according to taste  
Salt to taste  
Baking Soda - 1 pinch  
Rice Powder - 1 table spoon  

**Preparation**

The only paneer you can buy here is the frozen kind, so to give it that
fresh look just take it out of the package at put it in hot water. Once
it is soft, cut it in thick chunks so it will fit in between your
sandwich.

Prepare a smooth batter by mixing Chick pea flour, rice powder, salt,
red chili powder, baking soda and water. The rice powder is used here to
make crisp pakoras.

Spread Dhaniya Chutney on the bread, put your thick slices of paneer,
sprinkle some chat masala and close it with another slice of bread.

Heat some cooking oil in a vessel.

The last step is to dip your sandwich in the batter so it is covered
with the batter on all sides. A good way of doing this is to hold the
sandwich and start dipping into the batter, all the edges first and then
finish off by dipping on the two sides. Now put this in the hot oil and
deep fry till golden brown like you see it in the picture. Take it out
and put it on a wire rack to drain any oil out. Or just use some kitchen
napkins to soak up the excess oil out.

Cut the pakora into half's and sprinkle some chat masala before serving.
