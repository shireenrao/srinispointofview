I had a nice twitter exchange with @fugutruck last week where I was
recommended to try their Bi Bim Bap. I promised I would come to their
Downtown Boston location this week and true to my promise, I was there!

I took @Erickinboston and @steveobc with me as I wanted them to join me
this week. It was a beautiful day out and we decided to eat at the Post
Office square. Great decision!!

I knew what I wanted today... The Bi Bim Bap which is a Korean style
rice bowl mixed with meat, vegetables and a sweet pepper sauce, and off
course their sooo tasty pork buns!!

Here is what their Bi Bim Bap looks like

The week long wait for the Bi Bim Bap was totally worth it!! I loved the
flavors of the rice bowl. The best way to eat this is to mix everything
together. I didn't add the pepper sauce at first as I wanted to taste
this dish on its own. Then mixed the sauce to a little rice to see what
the flavors were like. The sauce definitely gives this dish more meaning
and taste!! All I can say is I am totally at peace after having another
wonderful meal at this fine establishment!!

@Fugutruck I bow to you for bringing such high standards to the Boston
Food Truck scene!!

See you guys soon..
