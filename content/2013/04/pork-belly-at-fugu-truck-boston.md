I got a chance to go out and try something new today at Fugu Truck. But
of course I still had to get their pork belly sandwich.. Just love me
some Fugu truck Pork Belly Sandwich!! This time I decided to go with the
grilled Pork Belly Sandwich instead of the steamed. The difference lies
in the texture of the bun. The grilled bun adds a certain crispness to
the dish. Very fresh and tasty!

The new dish I tried today was the Kimchee Bulgogi Panini..

The kimchi gives it a nice flavor. Both sandwiches were very tasty and
completely different.

These guys are making it really difficult for me to narrow down one
favorite dish. I still have 3 more dishes to try before I have eaten
their entire menu.. Keep posted to see the other dishes :)
