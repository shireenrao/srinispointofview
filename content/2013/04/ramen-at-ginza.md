My brother gave me some really good news 2 weeks ago..
[Ginza](http://www.ginza-boston.com/) in Boston Chinatown now offers
Ramen as part of their menu!! Soo exciting!! The best part is that Ginza
is a stones throw away from my workplace. If the ramen is any good, it's
going to be my goto place whenever I get a craving!! Bro told me that
they offer it in three different broths.. Clear Pork broth, Miso broth
and finally Soy based broth. I have got to try them all!!

Today I finally got a chance to go try it out.. I got the Clear Pork
broth Ramen and here is how it looks..

The broth tastes good and is very fulfilling. The Ramen noodles itself
had a good texture. I did wish I had more noodles... but it could also
just be the big bowl :). The pork slices could have been more tender but
over all I really enjoyed my lunch!

I had a quick chat with the staff and they promised me that the Ramen
was not a short time promotion and it was going to be part of their menu
going forward!! Yay!!!

I am now looking forward to going back to try the Soy and Miso based
broths.
