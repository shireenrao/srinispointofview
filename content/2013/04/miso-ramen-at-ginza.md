After trying out the [clear Pork Broth Ramen at Ginza last
[week]({filename}/2013/04/ramen-at-ginza.md), I got a chance to try their Miso Ramen
today.  Me so like it ;)  

Here are a few pics I got

Honestly.. it was good! The broth has a nice miso flavor and very
satisfying! The only difference between the Miso based Ramen and Pork
based Ramen other than the wonderful broth was a slice of butter on my
Miso Ramen. Also today the pork was tastier and more tender than the one
I had last time with my Pork Broth Ramen!

Last time I was there, the place was super busy and waited 30 minutes
for my order to come out. Today I was at Ginza by 11:40AM and I believe
was one of their first customers of the day. The service was quick in
comparison.

My friend from work who got the pork broth ramen was kind enough to let
me taste his pork broth so I could taste and compare the two broths..
it's a little tough to decide, but we both agreed that the pork broth is
the the winner!!

I now have the Soy based broth left to taste.. Will definitely come back
for it!!
