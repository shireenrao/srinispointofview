I was trying to copy some videos I had taken today to my laptop. I was
syncing my iPhone after a really long time.. actually since apple gave
us iCloud I dont have to sync for apps and pictures anymore. as I needed
to get the videos.. I had too.. Maybe I should use dropbox for this??
Ohh I digress! so back to what I was doing.. Oh yes, trying to sync my
phone.. I plugged in the USB and saw an error message pop up saying "No
Camera Fond". I tried a couple of things.. rebooted my phone and then my
laptop (Don't laugh.. I am a windows user at work).. Nothing worked.
Back to Google I found out what was wrong. My image capture settings had
changed after I installed Canon's imagebrowser software.

On the Mac, after the iPhone is connected to the computer, open the
Image Capture application. Select the iPhone and an option is presented
in the bottom of the left panel. Change the "Connecting this iPhone
opens" to an option of your choice. I chose "no application".
