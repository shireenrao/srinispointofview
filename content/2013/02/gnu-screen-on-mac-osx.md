Did you know Gnu Screen came default with your macs? I did not know
that!!  
I wanted to run one of my python scripts remotely on my mac mini to
detect duplicates in my image library. As this would take some time, I
didn't want to leave the session running on my laptop. I remembered
using screen when I was actively using linux a few years ago and thought
it would be a great solution here. First thing I did was do a quick
google search to see if there was a ready made package for mac OSX. To
my surprise I found out that it's already installed on my mac :)
Yipppee!!
