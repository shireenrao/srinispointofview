I love Egg fried rice. The best place for me to eat this is at [The
Best little
Restaurant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-best-little-restaurant-boston)
in Boston Chinatown. It's plain, simple and very flavorful. It's also
very quick to make at home.

**Ingredients**

-   Rice - 1 cup, preferably made in advance or left overs are best
-   Eggs - 3 lightly beaten
-   Scallions - 1/2 cup thinly sliced
-   Sesame oil - 1 teaspoon
-   Cooking Oil - 4 tablespoons. Peanut Oil preferred.
-   Salt - to taste
-   MSG - 2 pinches

**Preparation**  
All stir fries should be done over high heat. So heat a wok over high
heat. Add 2 table spoons of cooking oil, swirling to coat the wok
evenly, and heat until hot and just smoking. Season the lightly beaten
egg with a pinch of salt, slightly beat the eggs again to mix in the
salt. Add eggs and swirl the wok in all directions to form a thin even
layer on cooking surface, and cook. As soon as the egg sets, flip the
omlete. Another 30 seconds and you can now take it out of the wok. I
like my omlete to be a nice bright yellow, so I try not to over cook
this. Now add the remaining 2 table spoons of cooking oil and heat it.
Add the one teaspoon of sesame oil and then add the rice, salt, MSG and
stir-fry. Add the cooked eggs and break it up while mixing it into the
rice, letting rice rest several seconds between stirs, until rice is
hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add scallion greens and stir-fry until combined
well.

You can also add blanched mixed vegetables if you want to make it a
vegetable fried rice. You don't have to use Peanut oil if you don't have
it. I normally just use regular Olive Oil meant for saut√©ing instead of
peanut oil. Enjoy!
