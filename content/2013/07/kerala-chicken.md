This recipe is a variation on the Malabar mutton curry. I am using
chicken thighs instead of mutton or lamb. You can replace the chicken
with lamb or goat. It's quick and easy to do.

**Ingredients**  
Chicken thighs - 2 pounds  
Onions - 1 chopped  
Coriander powder - 1 tbsp  
Turmeric powder - 1/2 tsp  
Chili powder - 1/2 tsp  
Salt to taste

**Spice Paste**  
Grated coconut - 1/2 cup  
Fresh ginger - 1 inch  
Garlic - 3 cloves  
Cinnamon stick - 1 inch  
Cloves - 3  
Bay leaves - 2  
Curry leaves - 10  
Black peppercorns - 5

**For tempering**  
Mustard seeds - 1/2 tsp  
Curry leaves - 10  
Green chilies - 2 slit

**Method**  
Roast the ingredients for spice paste till coconut gets browned. Once
it cools down, grind to a fine paste in a food processor by adding water
gradually. Be careful and not add a lot of water and make it watery.

Now in a heavy bottom pan heat 3 tbsp of oil. Add your chopped onions
and fry for 5 minutes.  
Add the spice paste, ground coriander powder, turmeric powder, chili
powder and salt. stir the mixture for a minute and then add 1 and 1/2
cup of water.. Bring this to a boil.

Once a boil comes in, add your chicken. Reduce the heat and cook covered
for 30 minutes or till the chicken is cooked.

Prepare the tempering mixture in a small frying pan. Heat 1 tbps of oil
and add mustard seeds.  
Once they start popping, add curry leaves and slit green chilies.
Stir-fry for a minute. Add the tempering mixture to your meat curry and
continue cooking until curry is very dry and thick.

This should go really well with either rice or parathas!
