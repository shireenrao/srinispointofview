Is it wrong if I said "I Fugu You"?? (Read Fugu=Love). I think the food
in Fugu is made with such care and love that every dish comes out tasty
and you just want to come back for more..  
And that's what I did today. I went back for more.. Today I tried their
Cold Noodle salad with sesame sauce with Pork.

I think it is their best dish yet! It looks as pleasing as it is tasty..
the combination of cilantro, scallions and thinly sliced cucumbers and
carrots give a very colorful and fresh look! I should add that the
noodles were also cooked well.

Here are some pictures -

This is after mixing it all up with the extra hot chilli oil I asked for
(It's soo tasty... You must!!)
