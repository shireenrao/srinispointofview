My favorite Banh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwich) place in Chinatown Boston
introduced a bunch of new sandwiches on their menu. The place is called
[163 Vietnamese Sandwiches and Bubble
Tea](http://www.yelp.com/biz/163-vietnamese-sandwiches-and-bubble-tea-boston).
It's in 66 Harrison Avenue. The name is a mouthful for sure :)

The roast pork looked like thickly cut ham with the usual fixings of
vietnamese mayo, drizzle of some kind of fish sauce, thinly sliced
cucumbers carrots and daikon, chopped scallions and cilantro on a crispy
baguette. I usually ask for my sandwich to be spicy so they add some
chopped up Thai Chillies. For $3.75 it's a steal.

Here are some pics

The sandwich is good, but I think their pork chop sandwich, BBQ pork
Sandwich and cold cuts sandwich are much much better than this.
