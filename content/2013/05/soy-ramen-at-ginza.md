Finally got to go back to Ginza last week to try their Soy Ramen. So
tasty and refreshing.. I liked it! I still feel the Pork Broth Ramen is
the best tasting among all the options at Ginza.. But second place is a
tough choice. It is a tie between the miso and soy flavored Ramen!

Here are some pics
