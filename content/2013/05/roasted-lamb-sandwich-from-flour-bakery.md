Today I decided to walk to Flour Bakery + Cafe to try one of their
sandwich's and indulge in their famous sticky buns!

It was another beautiful day in Boston.. Bright, sunny and pleasant.

When I got their I decided on their Roast Lamb sandwich with tomato
chutney and goat cheese.. Sounds yum! For desert I went with their
sticky buns. Actually the bun was going to be a snack for later in the
day ;)

Decided to do take out and eat my lunch over looking the water.. Found a
beautiful wooden bench.. it was more like nicely varnished wooden
pillars joined together to look like a bench. Flour does a nice job with
their packaging for take out.

Sandwich does look tasty. Loved the bread. I would never have thought of
ever trying the combination of roast lamb with tomato chutney and goat
cheese. They sure go well! The goat cheese adds a nice tangy/tarty
flavor to the sandwich. I would have liked a wee bit more salt but maybe
it's just me.

The bakery has a good vibe and decor is hip. They have a lot of
different sandwiches and baked goods to offer so will have to come back
soon.
