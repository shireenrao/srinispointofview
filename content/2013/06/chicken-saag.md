This dish came out soo tasty! It goes really well with both cooked white
rice and chapatti's..

Here are the ingredients for this this -

-   Chicken thighs cut into small chunks - 2 pounds
-   Spinach - 2 bunches
-   Ginger - one inch
-   Garlic - 4 cloves
-   Green Chillies - 2
-   Bay Leaves - 2-3 leaves
-   Pepper Corns - 10
-   Onions - 1 chopped
-   Tomatoes - 3-4 chopped
-   Chilli Powder - 1/2 tsp
-   Coriander Powder - 2 tsp
-   Garam Masala - 1 and 1/2 tsp
-   Turmeric - 1/2 tsp
-   Yogurt - 1/2 cup
-   Salt to taste

**Method**

Cook the spinach in pan. Toss the spinach till it reduces for maybe 5
minutes. Put the cooked spinach with ginger, garlic, green chillies and
water if required in a blender and process to a thick puree.

Heat the oil in a large heavy pan. Add bay leaves and black peppercorns
and saut√© for a minute. Stir in the chopped onions and cook till golden
brown. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 6-8 minutes.

Now add the Chilli powder, Coriander Powder, Garam Masala, Turmeric and
salt and mix it into the tomato onion mixture. Cook for 2-3 minutes till
the oil starts to separate.

Stir in the spinach puree you made earlier. Add about 3/4 cup of water
and simmer for 5 minutes. Add your beaten yogurt and mix it well into
the spinach mixture and simmer for another 5 minutes. Now add your
chicken and stir the spinach to coat the chicken. Cover and cook for
25-30 minutes on medium to low heat till the chicken is tender.

Garnish with a dollop of yogurt and either server with warm Naan or hot
white rice

This dish can also be made with Paneer (indian cottage cheese) instead
of chicken. Just cut paneer into cubes and add at the point where you
add the chicken. Paneer does not need to be cooked for 25-30 minutes. It
will be ready in just 5-10 minutes
