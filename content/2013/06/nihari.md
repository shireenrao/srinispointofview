This is one of those dishes which brings really fond memories of my
childhood going to these shops in Old Delhi(India) serving Nihari early
in the morning. I think this is my favorite dish of all time!! This dish
is usually eaten early in the morning. Read
[this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihari) wikipedia entry for more
details on this dish.

Here is the recipe -

Ingredients for Nihari Masala

-   3 tbsp saunf/fennel
-   2-3 sticks dalchini/cinamom
-   6 choti elaichi/green cardamom
-   2 badi elaichi/black cardamom
-   12-15 kali mirch/black pepper seeds
-   1 tbsp sonth/dried ginger powder
-   6 pieces - javatiri/mace
-   nutmeg 1/2 inch piece
-   1.5 tbsp spoon lal mirch/red chili powder
-   1 tbsp dhaniya/coriander powder
-   1/4 tsp haldi/turmeric

Ingredients for the recipe

-   1 KG Lamb meat cut into big chunks. You can replace this with any
    red meat.
-   1 onion - chopped
-   2 tbsp adrak lahsun/ginger garlic paste
-   1 tbsp salt
-   1 tbsp lal mirch.red chili powder
-   4 tbsp of Nihari Masala
-   1/2 cup yogurt

Take all the ingredients for Nihari Masala and use a dry grinder or
coffee grinder to make a powder.  
Now take a heavy bottom vessel as you will be cooking the meat for
atleast 3-4 hours. I used an enameled dutch oven to cook this.

Add 1/2 cup of ghee to your vessel and heat on a medium flame.  
Add 1 chopped onion and cook till light golden  
Add 2 tbsp adrak lahsun/Ginger Garlic paste and cook for a minute  
Add your meat - 1 KG/2.2 Pounds and let it brown on all sides (maybe
2-3 minutes on each side)  
Add 1 tbsp salt  
Add 1 tbsp lal mirch/red chili powder  
Add 4 tbsp nihari masala pwder from above and mix it well.  
Now Add 1/2 cup dahi/yogurt and mix it well into all the meat.

At this point this is what you should be seeing -

Lower the heat and add about 10 cups of water. Cover up the vessel and
forget about this dish for the next 3-4 hours. Well almost. Just check
every 30 minutes to make sure the masala does not stick to the bottom of
the vessel. If the liquid evaporates and your meat hasn't become tender,
just add more water.

In my case the meat got tender in about 4 hours. I had to replenish the
water at about the 3 hour mark but your mileage might vary.

Once the meat is tender, make a very thin paste by mixing 1/2 cup of all
purpose flour and 4 tbsp of wheat flour with water. Add this mixture to
your dish. This is used as a thickening agent. Now keep a close eye on
your dish and make sure the bottom is not sticking. Don't overly mix the
dish as you don't want to break down the meat. Taste and add more salt
if required. Once you see a boil after adding the thin paste the dish
should be ready.

Add a garnish of julliened ginger, chopped cilantro and crispy fried
onions. Serve it with Naan or chappati.
