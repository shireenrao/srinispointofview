Ingredients

Salt - 1 tsp sprinkle all over the fish  
Pepper - sprinkle all over the fish  
Lemon - quarter wedge

Extra virgin olive oil

Apply salt, pepper and garlic powder to the fish. Then drizzle with the
olive oil and squeeze a quarter of lemon. Now seal the salmon in
aluminum foil.

Preheat the oven at 375 degrees. Put the packaged salmon on a baking
sheet and let it bake for 15 minutes.

Serve it hot with some rice pilaf, mashed potatoes and grilled
asparagus! Do not throw away the sauce you see in the above picture..
Drizzle that on top of fish before serving! It's super tasty!!

The picture below shows how the packaged foil looks like.
