This recipe is a slight twist from a different interesting recipe I came
across. The slight twist is the addition of Kasoori Methi. In english it
is called Fenugreek leaves. I will be using dried fenugreek leaves. I
think it is better than using fresh leaves as the dried leaves give a
very distinct flavor. You can get this from any Indian store. This dish
can be made without the addition of Kasoori Methi and it is still a very
tasty dish.

Another reason I thought this dish was interesting was because of the
use of fried onions paste. Checkout the ingredients and method to make
this dish!

**Ingredients**

-   Chicken - a whole chicken around 2 pounds(1.2kg) skinned and cut
    into 8 pieces
-   Onions - 2 large finely sliced
-   Garlic Paste - 2 tsp
-   Ginger Paste - 2 tsp
-   Tomatoes - 4 chopped
-   Yogurt - 1/2 cup
-   Red Chilli Powder - 1 tsp
-   Turmeric Powder - 1/2 tsp
-   Coriander Powder - 2 tsp
-   Black Cardamom - 3 pods
-   CLoves - 6
-   Bay Leaf - 1
-   Dried Fenugreek leaves - 1 tbsp
-   Cilantro - 3 tbsp chopped

**Method**

A point to note about the chicken is that if you don't like bone in
chicken you can make this dish with boneless thighs. Just use 2 pounds
of chicken thighs cut into chunks.

Heat about 1/4 cup of cooking oil in a heavy bottom pan. Add the onions
and cook till golden brown. Remove the pan from the heat and remove the
onions with a slotted spoon and let it cool down. Once it has cooled
down use a food processor to make a fine paste.

Return the pan to heat and add garlic and ginger paste. Stir for a
minute and then add the chopped tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes for a couple
of minutes and then mix in the yogurt. Now cook for 5-6 minute, mixing
every couple of minutes.

Mix in the onions paste you made earlier, along with all the spices
including the bay leaf, black cardamom and salt to taste. Cook, stirring
until the oil separates out.

Now add the chicken pieces and spoon the sauce over the chicken. Add 2
cups of water and mix the water in the sauce. Put the lid on the pan and
cook on low heat for 30-35 minutes, stirring occasionally so that the
bottom does not stick till the chicken is cooked. Add more water if
needed.

Remove the lid. Crush the fenugreek leaves in your hands and add to the
pan. Mix it into the sauce. Now cook with the lid open, mixing
occasionally till the oil separates out.

Add half of the cilantro to the pan and mix it into the sauce. Garnish
with the remaining cilantro and serve this with hot chapati's or Naan.

Hope you enjoy this Yummy Recipe! Here are some more pics of the dish..
