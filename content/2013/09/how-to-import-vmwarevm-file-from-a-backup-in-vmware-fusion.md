I recently re-installed Mountain Lion on my mac book pro. There were a
couple of reasons why I did that. Mainly because I wanted get rid of
macports and try out homebrew. The reason I wanted to do that was
because I am trying to setup a build and package process for my PyQt
applications, and macports based pyqt was not working out. Doing a setup
from scratch is a lot of work but it's fun for me.

In my previous setup I had two VM's, one was a mountain lion VM and the
other was a Snow Leopard VM for VMWARE. I had backed these two vmwarevm
files on my time machine. After re-installing vmware fusion I restored
the vmwarevm files in its default location.

I was expecting to see the two vm's in my library, but that wasn't the
case. Then I thought maybe I need to import these in. Clicking on
File->Import... did not work either. I couldn't even select the
vmwarevm files as shown in the image below -

I thought I would loose the vm's and would have to re-create these from
scratch :(

I tried to google for this, but couldn't find any solution for it. I
don't know what prompted me, but I remember I saw that the icon on the
two vm's was that for fusion. I then double clicked on one of the VM's
and viola!! It popped in my vmware library and started up!! Hurrah!!

That was easy!!
