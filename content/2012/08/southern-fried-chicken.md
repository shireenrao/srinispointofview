I had some craving for some fried chicken the other day and didn't want
to wait an entire day for marination. So looking around on the Internet
I found Paula Deens
[recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/southern-fried-chicken-recipe/index.html)
which was quick to make!

Here is my take on it.
