I was trying to see what version of java shipped with mountain lion. So
I opened a terminal session and typed 'java -version'. I was shocked to
see that there was no java. Instead I was greeted with a popup windows
with an option to install the 1.6 Java Run time.  
If one needs to get a jdk, one has to get it from oracle now.
