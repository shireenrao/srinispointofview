This is my favourite chicken dish of
all time! Not many restaurants in Boston serve this dish! The only place
I know of which even comes close to the same taste one would get in
delhi is Royal Bengal in Cambridge.. Here is my version..

This dish is actually made from
tandoori chicken but who has a tandoor.. so this has been modified so it
can easily be made at home. For those who are vegetarian can just skip
the chicken and either put fried tofu or fresh Paneer. As we only get
frozen paneer in the indian stores, what I do is put the frozen paneer
in hot water which completely softens the paneer.

**Marinate for Chicken**

-   Cut 4 pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs into bite size
    pieces
-   Season with 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, ¼ cup lemon juice, 2 table
    spoon ginger garlic paste and cover and put in ur fridge for 30
    minutes
-   Whisk ½ tsp red pepper powder, ½ tsp cumin powder, ¼ tsp turmeric
    pdr, 1tsp garam masala, 1 and ½ tsp coriander powder in 1-2 cups of
    yogurt and mix into the chicken. Put this back in the fridge for a
    couple of hours.

**Broil chicken**  
Spread the chicken in a drip tray and broil in the oven on high for 6-8
minutes on each side. Keep this aside.

**The Curry**

-   Heat a heavy bottom pan.. add 2 table spoon of butter and about ½
    cup of cooking oil ( I used olive oil (not evoo)).
-   Once oil is hot add about 1 tsp fenugreek seeds and let it crackly a
    bit.. don’t burn this as this can give your dish a bitter taster
-   once the fenugreek seeds are a little darker than its normal color
    add 2 finely sliced onions. ( I only use red onions in Indian
    cooking)
-   Cook till it is soft and light brown.. We don’t want it to be
    completely caramelized.
-   Now add 2 table spoons of ginger garlic paste. It will make a world
    of a difference if you use fresh ginger garlic instead of the store
    bought.
-   Slit 2 Thai chili peppers and add that to your pan
-   Now add your dry spices at this point. I put in salt, red pepper
    powder, garam masala, coriander powder, turmeric.
-   keep mixing the onions and the spices you added and don’t let things
    stick to the pan. You also don’t want to over cook the spices you
    added. Maybe 30 seconds depending on the heat.
-   Add two cans of crushed tomatoes and mix the onions into the sauce.
    Give this a good boil and keep mixing making sure it doesn’t stick
    to the pan.
-   crush 2-3 tsp of kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves) in your
    hands and mix into the pan
-   Now add half a pint of light cream into the sauce and mix.
-   Bring it to a boil and then add the broiled chicken.
-   Another boil should finish the dish.
